<pre>Display the same data in many different ways. I will call each a "view". The goal of the collection of all views is to understand the central "whole" in question, not to lead the viewer in circles.
	
Each "view" has a different purpose to this end.

The left view ("context") presents the start & end (or introduction & conclusion, or problem & solution) and focuses on back-links giving greater context to why this whole has a purpose. Why was it created? Why might you be here in the first place, now?

The central view ("1 whole") has a linear flow connecting the start to the end. How does the start connect to the end? How is this the solution to the problem? How does the conclusion resolve the introduction? And, what is introduction?

The right view ("parts") links to supplementary wholes, especially those given purpose from the perspective of the present one. A major purpose of this view is to give the present whole its identity, encapsulating detail into their own parts when possible.</pre>
